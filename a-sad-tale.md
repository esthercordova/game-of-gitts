House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

This is the real end but I really don't care.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!

Come on Esther, you could have done better! Joffrey is a big baby and deserves
to be spanked!
